Curate and manage featured plugins from a remote JSON source with real-time WordPress.org data.

== Description ==

Featured Curator allows you to curate and manage the featured plugins list from a remote JSON source while pulling real, up-to-date data from WordPress.org. Perfect for agencies, hosting companies, and WordPress networks that want to provide a customized plugin installation experience.

= Features =

* **Remote Control**: Manage featured plugins from a centralized JSON file
* **Live Data**: Pulls real-time plugin information from WordPress.org
* **Complete Plugin Cards**: Displays all standard plugin information including icons, ratings, downloads, author info, and compatibility
* **Smart Caching**: Configurable caching system for optimal performance
* **Security First**: Built with WordPress security best practices
* **API Authentication**: Optional Bearer token support for protected endpoints
* **Health Checks**: Test remote connectivity directly from admin
* **Fallback Mode**: Automatically falls back to WordPress.org defaults if remote is unavailable
* **Detailed Logging**: WP_DEBUG-aware error logging
* **Cache Management**: Easy cache refresh and statistics viewing

= How It Works =

1. The plugin fetches plugin slugs from your remote JSON file
2. For each slug, it retrieves complete data from WordPress.org API
3. Data includes all standard plugin card fields: name, description, icons, ratings, downloads, author info, compatibility, and more
4. Everything is cached based on your configured duration
5. If remote is unreachable, WordPress.org defaults are shown

= JSON Format =

Your remote JSON file can use either format:

**Simple Array (Recommended)**

`[
  "contact-form-7",
  "wordpress-seo",
  "woocommerce"
]`

**Object with Metadata**

`{
  "version": "1.0",
  "last_updated": "2025-10-23",
  "plugins": [
    "contact-form-7",
    "wordpress-seo",
    "woocommerce"
  ]
}`

= Requirements =

* WordPress 5.8 or higher
* PHP 7.4 or higher
* wp_remote_get enabled (standard WordPress HTTP API)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/featured-curator` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Navigate to Tools → Featured Plugins to configure the plugin
4. Enter your remote JSON file URL
5. Optionally add an API key if your endpoint requires authentication
6. Click "Test Connection" to verify your remote source
7. Save settings and visit Plugins → Add New → Featured to see your curated list

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I host my JSON file? =

You can host your JSON file anywhere that's publicly accessible via HTTP or HTTPS - your own server, GitHub, a CDN, etc.

= What if my remote source is unavailable? =

The plugin automatically falls back to WordPress.org's default featured plugins if your remote source cannot be reached.

= Can I protect my JSON endpoint? =

Yes! You can configure an API key in the settings, which will be sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.

= How often does the plugin fetch data? =

The plugin caches data according to your configured cache duration (1-24 hours). You can manually refresh the cache at any time.

= What happens if a plugin slug is invalid? =

Invalid slugs are skipped, and only valid plugins from WordPress.org are displayed.
